## Quality tests

This category of tests will be focused on metrics that impact the perceived quality of models. The motivation is that measures like pcc, atol and rtol don't
show the real picture regarding how the customers see the model performance.

Perceived quality should be measured end to end, with metrics that are application-dependent.
