# üß† LLaMA 3.1‚Äì8B: Tensor Parallel JAX Implementation (Draft PR)

This draft PR adds a tensor-parallel JAX implementation of Meta‚Äôs LLaMA 3.1‚Äì8B model using a 2√ó4 device mesh. The code supports both sharded and unsharded execution and matches Hugging Face‚Äôs PyTorch reference implementation.

---

## ‚úÖ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python and Create Virtual Environment
```
sudo apt install python3.12-venv
mkdir tt
cd tt
python3.12 -m venv llama
source llama/bin/activate
```
### 2. Hugging Face Login
```
You must log into Hugging Face to download the LLaMA 3.1 weights.

pip install huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli login

    Make sure you've requested access to the Meta LLaMA 3 model: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama
```
### üåø Branch for This Implementation

### üìÅ Download and Structure Model Files
```
mkdir -p sw/llama3.1-8B/original
mkdir -p sw/llama3.1-8B/8B

huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B original/tokenizer.model --local-dir sw/llama3.1-8B/original
huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B original/consolidated.00.pth --local-dir sw/llama3.1-8B
huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B original/params.json --local-dir sw/llama3.1-8B

mv sw/llama3.1-8B/consolidated.00.pth sw/llama3.1-8B/8B/
mv sw/llama3.1-8B/params.json sw/llama3.1-8B/8B/

Final structure:

sw/llama3.1-8B/

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ original/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tokenizer.model
```

### üì¶ Install Python Dependencies
```
Make sure you're using Python ‚â•3.10 (tested on 3.12):

pip install -r tests/jax/models/llama/3_1_8b/requirements.txt
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Scripts
```
You can run any of the available generation scripts using:

python3 tests/jax/models/llama/3_1_8b/generate_jax.py
python3 tests/jax/models/llama/3_1_8b/generate_hf.py
python3 tests/jax/models/llama/3_1_8b/generate_jax_unsharded.py

    generate_jax.py: Runs the sharded tensor-parallel JAX model (2√ó4 mesh).

    generate_jax_unsharded.py: Runs the unsharded JAX model.

    generate_hf.py: Runs the Hugging Face PyTorch reference model.

In generate_hf.py and generate_jax_unsharded.py, there are three example prompts commented in the code that can be modified for testing.

‚úÖ All three scripts produce identical outputs for the same input prompt (up to floating point precision).
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on generate_jax.py (Tensor-Parallel Sharded)

When running the sharded JAX model on a 2√ó4 mesh:

‚ùó RAM usage exceeds 64 GB during sharding and the process is killed.

‚ùì Questions & Feedback

    Can you try running generate_jax.py on your end with more RAM?

        To confirm memory requirements.

        To verify whether the issue is hardware-related.

    Prompt formatting:

        I'm currently using 2-shot prompting, which ensures consistent outputs between the sharded JAX and Hugging Face PyTorch models.

        ‚ùì Is it expected that prompting style affects alignment?

    Correctness checks:

        ‚úÖ I have verified that the logits match exactly between:

            Sharded JAX

            Unsharded JAX

            Hugging Face PyTorch

    Memory use:

        ‚ùì Is it expected that sharding the LLaMA 3.1 8B model exceeds 64 GB RAM?

        Or is there something incorrect in the sharding logic?

Let me know how I can improve this or whether the memory limit is just a system constraint üôè
