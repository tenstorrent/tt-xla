"""
From XLA documentation: '(Composite operation) Encapsulates an operation made up (composed) of
other StableHLO operations, taking inputs and composite_attributes and producing results.
The semantics of the op are implemented by the decomposition attribute. The composite op can be
replaced with its decomposition without changing program semantics.'

So, composite op is made because of high-level ops that are decomposed into dozens stable HLO
operations. It enables custom backends to handle op however they want. Since we have a native
support for, let's say, gelu operation in ttir, we will wrap torch gelu op into gelu composite
op and handle it in XLA without decompostions, enabling our device to execute custom gelu implementation.

Since we want to run torch models wihout modifying them, we will substitute torch operations
(that we have a direct support for) with composite ops. This way, user will not have to change
anything in model in order to get performance improvement.
