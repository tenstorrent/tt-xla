tests/runner/test_models.py::test_all_models[opt/sequence_classification/pytorch-facebook/opt-125m-data_parallel-full-inference] Some weights of OPTForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/opt-125m and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
