## PR Guidelines
### Community contributions
Thank you for your interest in the TT-XLA project, we appreciate your support.
For all PRs, we have an internal policy listed below which your PR will go through after an initial review has been done.

The initial review will encompass the following:
* Reviewing the PR for CI/CD readiness, making sure that the code and PR at a high level make sense for the project.
* Once approved for CI/CD readiness, a Tenstorrent developer will kick off our CI/CD pipeline on your behalf.

### Internal contributions
For internal contributions we have the following guidelines:
* At least 1 reviewer signs off on the change
* Component owners sign-offs (GitHub will tell you if this hasn't been met)
* Green CI
